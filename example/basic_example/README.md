# QuantaDB Basic Example

This example demonstrates the basic usage of QuantaDB, a high-performance NoSQL local database built entirely in Dart.

## Features Demonstrated

- Opening a database
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Querying all records using the query engine
- Proper resource cleanup

## Running the Example

1. Make sure you have Dart installed
2. Run the example:

```bash
dart run lib/main.dart
```

## Expected Output

The example will demonstrate:
- Creating and storing user records
- Retrieving user data
- Updating user information
- Deleting user records
- Querying all records in the database

## Code Structure

The example is intentionally kept simple to demonstrate the core functionality of QuantaDB. It shows:

1. Database initialization
2. Basic data operations
3. Query operations
4. Proper cleanup

## Next Steps

After understanding this basic example, you can explore:
- Advanced querying with filters and sorting
- Using type-safe models with code generation
- Implementing reactive queries
- Working with transactions
- Using indexes for better performance
