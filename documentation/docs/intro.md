## Why Choose QuantaDB?

QuantaDB aims to overcome the limitations of existing local databases by providing a pure Dart implementation with a high-performance LSM-Tree engine. Our goals are to offer competitive read/write performance, a simple API, data durability, support for complex data models, and a reactive query system.

## Performance

QuantaDB is designed for speed. Benchmarks show significantly faster performance compared to other popular Dart/Flutter local databases, especially for write operations. [Check out the benchmark code on GitHub](https://github.com/champ96k/quanta_db#performance-benchmarks--).

## Architecture

QuantaDB features a layered architecture with the core LSM-Tree storage engine. [Learn more about the architecture on GitHub](https://github.com/champ96k/quanta_db#architecture).

## Getting Started

To start using QuantaDB, add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  quanta_db: ^0.0.5 # Use the latest version
```

Then, run `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get`.

Import the package and open your database:

```dart
import 'package:quanta_db/quanta_db.dart';

void main() async {
  // Open the database
  final db = await QuantaDB.open('my_database');

  // Use the database...

  // Close the database when done
  await db.close();
}
```

QuantaDB automatically handles platform-specific secure directory management.
