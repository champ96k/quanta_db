# Data Security

QuantaDB prioritizes the security of your local data, offering built-in features to help you protect sensitive information.

Key security features include:

- **Optional Field-Level Encryption:** QuantaDB provides the option to encrypt data at the field level. This allows you to specifically encrypt sensitive data fields within your stored objects, adding a layer of protection against unauthorized access to the raw data files.
- **Secure Storage:** The database handles platform-specific secure directory management. This means QuantaDB automatically stores your database files in locations on the user's device that are designed to be secure and typically protected from access by other applications.
- **Access Control:** QuantaDB includes built-in support for access control lists (ACLs). This feature allows you to define permissions for different users or roles, controlling who can read, write, or delete data within the database.
- **Data Validation:** Support for runtime and compile-time data validation helps ensure data integrity and prevent the storage of malformed or malicious data.
- **Audit Logging:** QuantaDB offers optional audit logging, which can record database operations. This is useful for tracking changes, monitoring access, and meeting compliance requirements.

By utilizing these security features, you can enhance the protection of the data managed by QuantaDB in your applications.
