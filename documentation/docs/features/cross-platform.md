# Cross-Platform Compatibility

One of the significant advantages of QuantaDB is its **cross-platform compatibility**. Because QuantaDB is built entirely in pure Dart, it can run on all platforms supported by the Dart and Flutter SDKs.

This means you can use QuantaDB as your local database solution seamlessly across:

-   **Mobile:** iOS and Android applications built with Flutter.
-   **Desktop:** Windows, macOS, and Linux applications built with Flutter or pure Dart.
-   **Web:** (Depending on specific features and ongoing support) Potentially in web applications compiled with Dart.

The pure Dart implementation ensures a consistent API and behavior across all supported platforms, simplifying development and reducing platform-specific code.

This cross-platform capability makes QuantaDB an ideal choice for projects targeting multiple environments with a single codebase.
