# Powerful Query Engine

QuantaDB includes a powerful query engine that allows you to efficiently retrieve, filter, and sort data stored in your database. This provides you with the flexibility to access the specific data you need, in the order you prefer.

Key aspects of the QuantaDB query engine include:

- **Filtering:** You can apply various filters to select data based on specific criteria. This allows you to retrieve subsets of your data that match certain conditions.
- **Sorting:** The query engine supports sorting results based on one or more fields, in ascending or descending order. This is essential for presenting data in a meaningful sequence.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Leveraging the underlying LSM-Tree structure and potentially utilizing indexes (see Advanced Indexing), the query engine is designed for fast data retrieval, even from large datasets.
- **Reactive Queries (Real-time Updates):** As mentioned in the features list, QuantaDB supports reactive queries. This means you can subscribe to query results and receive real-time notifications when the underlying data changes, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive applications.

The powerful query engine, combined with efficient data access mechanisms, makes it easy to work with your data in QuantaDB.
