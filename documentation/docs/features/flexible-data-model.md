# Flexible Data Model

QuantaDB offers a flexible data model, providing developers with the agility to handle diverse and evolving data structures without the constraints of rigid schemas often found in traditional relational databases.

As a NoSQL database with a key-value store foundation, QuantaDB allows you to store data in a semi-structured or unstructured format. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for:

- **Rapid Development:** You can quickly iterate on your data structure as your application evolves without requiring complex schema migrations.
- **Handling Diverse Data:** Easily store objects with varying fields or nested structures within the same database.
- **Adapting to Change:** As your application's data needs change, you can adapt your data model easily without significant database restructuring.

QuantaDB stores data using a custom binary serialization format (DartBson), which efficiently handles complex data types and structures, further enhancing the flexibility of the data model.
