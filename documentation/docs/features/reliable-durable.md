# Reliable and Durable

Ensuring the safety and persistence of your data is paramount. QuantaDB is built with reliability and durability in mind, providing confidence that your data is secure and available when you need it.

Key aspects contributing to QuantaDB's reliability and durability include:

- **ACID Transactions:** QuantaDB supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant transactions. This means that database operations are processed reliably, ensuring that data remains in a consistent state, even in the event of system failures.
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** Like many robust database systems, QuantaDB utilizes a Write-Ahead Log. Before any changes are applied to the main data files, they are first recorded in a log file. This ensures that even if a crash occurs during a write operation, the database can recover to a consistent state by replaying the log.
- **Data Checksumming:** Data stored on disk can be protected with checksums to detect corruption, although specific implementation details might vary.
- **Platform-Specific Secure Storage:** QuantaDB handles directory management to utilize platform-specific secure locations for storing database files, adding a layer of protection against unauthorized access.

These mechanisms work together to make QuantaDB a reliable and durable choice for your local data storage needs.
