# LSM Storage Engine

QuantaDB's LSM (Log-Structured Merge Tree) storage engine provides high-performance, reliable data storage with automatic optimization.

## Overview

The LSM storage engine automatically:
- Manages memory and disk storage
- Handles data compaction
- Optimizes read and write performance
- Maintains data consistency
- Provides atomic operations

## Key Features

### 1. MemTable
- In-memory storage using `SplayTreeMap`
- O(log n) write performance
- Automatic flushing to disk

### 2. SSTable
- On-disk storage with block alignment
- Efficient range queries
- Automatic merging and compaction

### 3. Bloom Filters
- Three-layer bloom filters (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit)
- Fast key existence checks
- Memory-efficient lookups

### 4. Background Compaction
- Isolate-based workers
- Zero-copy memory buffers
- Automatic space reclamation

## Performance

The LSM storage engine is optimized for:
- High write throughput
- Efficient range queries
- Low memory footprint
- Automatic optimization

## Usage

You don't need to interact with the LSM storage directly. QuantaDB handles all storage operations automatically when you use the high-level APIs.

## Internal Architecture

> **Note**: The following sections explain the internal architecture. This is all handled automatically by QuantaDB.

### Storage Layers
1. MemTable (Memory)
2. SSTable (Disk)
3. Bloom Filters (Cache)

### Compaction Strategy
- Level-based compaction
- Size-tiered compaction
- Automatic level management

### Performance Optimizations
- Block caching
- Compression
- Index optimization
- Memory management

## Error Handling

The system automatically handles:
- Disk space management
- Data corruption
- Recovery procedures
- Consistency checks

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Enhanced compression
- Advanced caching
- Improved compaction
- Better memory management
