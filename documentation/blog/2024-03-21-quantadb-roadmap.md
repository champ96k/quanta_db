Today, I'm excited to share our detailed roadmap for QuantaDB, highlighting what we've accomplished and what's coming next. This roadmap reflects our commitment to building a high-performance, developer-friendly database solution for the Dart and Flutter ecosystem.

## What We've Built So Far 🏗️

### Phase 1: Core Storage Engine ✅

We've successfully implemented the foundation of QuantaDB with a pure Dart LSM-Tree storage engine. Here's what's already working:

- **High-Performance Storage**
  - MemTable using `SplayTreeMap` for O(log n) writes
  - SSTable serialization with 4KB block alignment
  - Three-layer Bloom filters for lightning-fast lookups
  - Background compaction using `Isolate` workers

- **Robust Data Management**
  - Transaction support with atomic operations
  - Type-safe change notifications
  - Efficient binary serialization with DartBson
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Phase 2: Code Generation (In Progress) 🔄

We're currently working on making QuantaDB more developer-friendly through annotation-driven code generation:

- **Completed Features**
  - `@QuantaEntity` annotation system
  - Primary key and index support
  - Field validation with constraints
  - Schema version tracking
  - Basic composite indexes

- **Currently Working On**
  - Type adapter generation
  - DAO class generation
  - Enhanced schema validation
  - Advanced index management

## What's Coming Next 🚀

### Phase 2 Completion (Q2 2024)

We're focusing on completing these critical features:

- **Relationship Management**
  - Entity relationships
  - Referential integrity
  - Efficient relationship querying

- **Advanced Validation**
  - Custom validation functions
  - Compile-time validation
  - Runtime data quality checks

### Phase 3: Reactive Query System (Q3 2024)

Our next major phase will bring real-time capabilities:

- **Stream-Based Watching**
  - Real-time query updates
  - Efficient change detection
  - Query result caching
  - Incremental updates

- **Change Notification Pipeline**
  - Object hashing system
  - Batched updates
  - Isolate-based propagation
  - Memory-efficient diffing

## Performance Goals 🎯

We're committed to maintaining high performance while adding new features:

| Operation          | Target (100k ops) | Current Status |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Bulk Insert        | 820ms             | ✅ Achieved    |
| Point Query        | 0.8μs             | ✅ Achieved    |
| Range Query        | 4.2ms             | ✅ Achieved    |
| Encrypted Write    | 1.9ms/op          | 🔄 In Progress |
| Change Propagation | 12ms latency      | ⏳ Planned     |
