I'm excited to announce the beta release of **QuantaDB**, a high-performance NoSQL local database built entirely in Dart. After months of development and testing, we're ready to share this powerful database solution with the Dart and Flutter community.

## Why QuantaDB?

As a Flutter developer, I've often encountered limitations with existing local database solutions. Many options either had external dependencies, performance bottlenecks, or lacked modern features. This led me to create QuantaDB, a database that addresses these challenges while providing a developer-friendly experience.

## Key Features

### üöÄ High Performance
QuantaDB implements a Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM-Tree) storage engine from scratch in pure Dart. Our benchmarks show impressive results:
- 10,000 write operations in just 30ms
- 10,000 read operations in 9ms
- Batch operations (1000 items) completed in 15ms

### üîí Data Security
Security is a top priority:
- Built-in field-level encryption
- Platform-specific secure storage
- Access control lists
- Runtime and compile-time validation

### üìä Advanced Features
- Real-time updates with reactive queries
- Type safety with code generation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Powerful query engine with filtering and sorting
- ACID compliant transactions
- Efficient handling of large datasets

## Architecture

QuantaDB is built with a layered architecture:

1. **Application Layer**: Public API and code generation integration
2. **Core Engine Layer**: Query processing and storage management
3. **Storage Layer**: LSM-Tree implementation with MemTable and SSTables
4. **Platform Layer**: File system interaction and background tasks

## Getting Started

Adding QuantaDB to your project is straightforward:

```yaml
dependencies:
  quanta_db: ^0.0.2
```

Basic usage example:

```dart
import 'package:quanta_db/quanta_db.dart';

void main() async {
  final db = await QuantaDB.open('my_database');
  
  // Store data
  await db.put('user:1', {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'email': 'john@example.com'
  });
  
  // Retrieve data
  final user = await db.get('user:1');
  print('User: $user');
  
  await db.close();
}
```

## Performance Comparison

We've benchmarked QuantaDB against popular alternatives:

| Operation | QuantaDB | Hive  | SQLite |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Write     | 30ms     | 216ms | 3290ms |
| Read      | 9ms      | 8ms   | 299ms  |
| Batch     | 15ms     | 180ms | 2800ms |

## What's Next?

While we're proud of what we've achieved, this is just the beginning. Our roadmap includes:

1. Enhanced query capabilities
2. More advanced indexing options
3. Improved documentation and examples
4. Community-driven feature development
