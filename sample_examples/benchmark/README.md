# Database Benchmark Results v1

This benchmark compares the performance of three databases: QuantaDB, Hive, and SQLite for read and write operations.

## Test Configuration
- Number of operations: 10,000
- Test type: Read and Write operations
- Data type: Key-value pairs

## Results

### Write Operations

    title Write Operations (10,000 entries)
    x-axis Database
    y-axis Time (ms)
    QuantaDB 24
    Hive 178
    SQLite 3546
```

### Read Operations
```mermaid

    title Read Operations (10,000 entries)
    x-axis Database
    y-axis Time (ms)
    QuantaDB 10
    Hive 10
    SQLite 296
```

### Performance Comparison

| Database | Write Time (ms) | Read Time (ms) | Write Speed (ops/ms) | Read Speed (ops/ms) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| QuantaDB | 24            | 10            | 416.67             | 1000.00          |
| Hive     | 178           | 10            | 56.18              | 1000.00          |
| SQLite   | 3546          | 296           | 2.82               | 33.78            |

## Analysis

1. **QuantaDB**
   - Fastest for write operations (24ms)
   - Tied for fastest read operations (10ms)
   - Best overall performance

2. **Hive**
   - Moderate write performance (178ms)
   - Excellent read performance (10ms)
   - Good balance for read-heavy applications

3. **SQLite**
   - Slowest for write operations (3546ms)
   - Slowest for read operations (296ms)
   - Better suited for smaller datasets

## Conclusion
QuantaDB shows superior performance for both read and write operations, making it the best choice for high-performance applications. Hive provides a good balance, especially for read-heavy workloads, while SQLite might be more suitable for smaller datasets or less performance-critical applications.
